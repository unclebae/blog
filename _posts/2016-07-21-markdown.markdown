This is an H1
=============

This is an H2
-------------

# This is a H1
## This is a H2
### This is a H3
#### This is a H4
##### This is a H5
###### This is a H6

> This is a blockqute.

# Example Text
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words
*italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!]
(http://google.com)

# Example Lists
sometimes you want numbered lists:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:
* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,
- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have points, put tow spaces before the dash or star:
  - Link this
  - And this

# Example Images
If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

# Example Header and Quotes
# Strucutred document
Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to 
structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings.
Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading
You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading size

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Caption Janeway

#Example Code
There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown.
If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.
If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:
    if (isAwesome) {
		return true
	}

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:
```
if (isAwesome) {
	return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax hjighlighting, include the language:
```javascript
if (isAwesome) {
	return true
}
```

# Example Extras
GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people.
If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath - love your sweater!

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my faverite:
- [X] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is a incomplete item

When you include a task list in the first commetn of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues.
It works in Pull Requests, too!

And, of course emoji! :sparkles: :camel: :boom:


## Syntax guide
Here's an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

## Headers
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

## Emphasis
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

## Lists
### Unordered

* Item1
* Item2
  * Item2a
  * Item2b

### Ordered

1. Item1
2. Item2
3. Item3
  * Item3a
  * Item3b

### Images
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)

### Links
http://github.com - automatic!
[GitHub](http://github.com)

### Blockquotes
As Kanye West said:
> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

### Inline code
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.


# GitHub Flavored Markdown
GitHub.com uses its own version of Markdown syntax that provides an additional set fo useful features, many of which
make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com

Note that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments
of Issues and Pull Requests.
this include @mentions as well as references to S/HA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests.

Task LIsts are also available in Gist commetns and in Gist markdown files.

## Syntax highlighting

Here's an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with GitHub Flavored Markdown:
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
	if (arg) {
		$.facebook({div:'#foo'})
	}
}

You can also simply indent your code by four spaces;
function fancyAlert(arg) {
	if (arg) {
	    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
	}
}

## Task lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting** and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (and undered of ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an imcomplete item

If you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will get a handy progress indicator in your issue list.
it al works in Pull Request!

## Tables
You can create tables by accsembling a list of world and divdding them with hyphenes `-` (for the first row), and them separating each column with a pipe |:
First Header | Second Headler
------------  ----------------
Content from ceil 1 Content from call be
Content in the first column |Content in the restorigin)
